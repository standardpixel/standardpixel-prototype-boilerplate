Clustr for node.js
==================

This is (going to be) a tool for generating alpha shapes from Flickr photo geo information for a woe_id.

My plan is to replace Clustr with this some day and make it open source. When it is all working hunkey dorey, it will generate version 3.0 of the Flickr alpha shapes.

Questions? Ask away...
