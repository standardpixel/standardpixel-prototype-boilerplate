Prototype Boilerplate
===================

A npm module for creating a node / express / handlebars stack to support 
quick prototypes. When I have an idea I usually loose about 40 minutes 
setting up an environment for it. This should help me avoid that.


To make things simple, this boilerplate assumes you will need the following:
   * Web server
   * Database connection (SimpleDB)
   * Data management scripts. (list, delete, create, etc...)
   * Testing
